The way to transfer a protein with PDB file to HyRes form is very easy to follow :3

1. Have your PDB in s1 folder. You can download them from website.

2. clean the PDB to forms that CHARMM prefer to read! especially for some residues that have strange residue names.

3. make a united AT PDB.

4. Transfer AT to CG (HyRes) form. You can carry it directly by changing the command:
   /home/xrliu/local/bin/at2cg.py $inp $out
   To:
   at2cg.py $inp $out
   at2cg.py script is here.

5. A quick minimization before final equilibration. Can check Rg and RMSD to see if large deviation shoing up.

6. Run the annealing simulation. You can change the time to any longer as you wanted to have the simulation. 
   You can also change the annealing temperature as you like! 
   Here I used: 
   nstep=100000 (100 ps), 
   First_temp as 500k, 
   Final_temp @300 K, as an example :3

7. Run the real prod simulation! (call on SASA here!)
